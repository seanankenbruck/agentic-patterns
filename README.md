# Agentic Workflow Patterns

A collection of agentic workflow pattern implementations using the Anthropic SDK for TypeScript. Each pattern demonstrates different approaches to building AI-powered applications with Claude.

## Patterns

### ✅ Implemented

#### [Prompt Chaining](./prompt-chaining)
Sequential processing where each LLM call's output feeds into the next step. Ideal for multi-stage transformations and analysis pipelines.

#### [Parallelization](./parallelization)
Execute independent LLM tasks concurrently to improve performance. Useful for batch processing and multi-faceted analysis.

#### [Routing](./routing)
Intelligently route requests to specialized models or prompts based on input classification. Optimizes for cost, latency, and accuracy.

#### [Orchestrator-Worker](./otel-orchestrator-project)
Coordinate multiple worker agents from a central orchestrator. Demonstrates task decomposition, parallel execution, and result aggregation with OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

#### [Evaluator-Optimizer](./evaluator-optimizer)
Iterative refinement loop where an evaluator provides feedback to improve generated artifacts. Generates and optimizes OpenAPI specifications through validation and quality assessment cycles.

#### Reason-Act [ReAct](./reason-act)
Interleave reasoning and action steps, allowing the agent to dynamically plan and execute based on observations.

#### [Agent Collaboration](./agent-debate-workflow)
Multiple specialized agents work together, coordinating to solve complex tasks through negotiation and information sharing.

#### [Autonomous Agent](https://github.com/seanankenbruck/autonomous-research-agent)
An autonomous AI agent with persistent memory, adaptive learning, and multi-session capabilities for conducting research tasks. This pattern has been moved to its own repo.

## Getting Started

Each pattern directory contains:
- Complete working implementation
- Dedicated README with usage instructions
- Test cases demonstrating the pattern
- TypeScript examples with the Anthropic SDK

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- Anthropic API key

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd agentic-patterns

# Install dependencies for a specific pattern
cd <pattern-directory>
npm install
```

### Running Examples

Navigate to any pattern directory and follow its README for specific instructions. Most patterns can be run with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
