# Debate Transcript: Should we build or buy an observability platform for our company?

**Date:** 12/15/2025, 1:39:33 PM

**Context:** Our company is a fast-growing SaaS startup with 50 engineers and a microservices architecture running on Kubernetes. We currently have basic monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, but we lack comprehensive distributed tracing, log aggregation, and real-time alerting. The engineering team is split on whether to build a custom observability solution using open-source tools (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Loki) or purchase a commercial platform (Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace). Budget for year one is $500K, and we have 2-3 engineers who could be allocated to building/maintaining an in-house solution.

## Debate Discussion

### Moderator (moderator)
*Round 1*

Welcome to today's debate on a critical infrastructure decision that will significantly impact our company's operational capabilities and resource allocation. We're here to discuss whether our fast-growing SaaS startup should build a custom observability platform using open-source tools or purchase a commercial solution. This decision affects not just our technical capabilities, but our budget allocation, engineering focus, and long-term operational resilience. With 50 engineers managing a complex microservices architecture, observability isn't just a nice-to-have—it's essential for maintaining system reliability, debugging issues quickly, and ensuring our customers have a seamless experience. We have three key stakeholders here today: engineering, business, and security perspectives. Each brings crucial considerations to this $500K decision that will shape how we monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize our systems for years to come.

### Marty McFly (business)
*Round 1*

Look, I'm going to cut straight to the chase here - we absolutely need to **buy** a commercial observability platform, and frankly, I'm surprised this is even a debate.

Here's my core argument: **We're hemorrhaging opportunity cost every day we don't have proper observability, and building it ourselves would be a massive strategic mistake that could derail our entire growth trajectory.**

Let me break down why:

**First, time to market is everything.** With a commercial solution like Datadog or New Relic, we're talking about getting comprehensive observability up and running in weeks, maybe a month. Building our own? We're looking at 6-12 months minimum before we have something remotely comparable, and that's assuming everything goes perfectly - which it never does. Every day we're flying blind on system performance is a day we're risking customer churn and missing growth opportunities.

**Second, the math on engineering allocation is brutal.** Those 2-3 engineers we'd dedicate to building this? That's 20-30% of our engineering capacity that could be shipping features that directly drive revenue. At our stage, that opportunity cost is astronomical. I'd rather have those engineers building the product features that help us close our next $10M in ARR than reinventing the observability wheel.

**Third, total cost of ownership is way more predictable with a buy decision.** Yes, $500K sounds like a lot upfront, but it's a known quantity. Building internally? We'll blow through that budget on engineering salaries alone, and that doesn't include the ongoing maintenance, scaling challenges, and inevitable feature gaps we'll need to fill. Commercial platforms give us predictable OpEx that scales with our business.

**Finally, risk mitigation is huge here.** When our systems go down at 2 AM, do we really want to be debugging our homegrown observability stack while our customers are screaming? Commercial vendors have battle-tested solutions, 24/7 support, and SLAs. That peace of mind is worth every penny.

The bottom line: we're a SaaS startup, not an observability company. Let's focus on what makes us money and buy the infrastructure we need to scale.

### Moderator (moderator)
*Round 1*

[To engineer] Marty makes a compelling case about opportunity cost and time-to-market, but as the technical lead, you understand the engineering reality better than anyone. Given our specific architecture - 50 engineers managing microservices on Kubernetes with existing Prometheus/Grafana - how do you respond to his concerns about the 6-12 month timeline and ongoing maintenance burden? And critically, do you believe the technical capabilities and customization we'd gain from building would justify diverting 20-30% of our engineering capacity from revenue-generating features?

---

### Jennifer Parker (engineer)
*Round 2*

**I fundamentally disagree with Marty's assessment, and frankly, I think he's overlooking some critical technical realities that could bite us hard down the road.**

Let me be clear: **We should build our observability platform using open-source tools, and Marty's timeline concerns are based on a false premise.**

**First, his 6-12 month timeline is completely off base.** We're not starting from scratch here - we already have Prometheus and Grafana running. Adding distributed tracing with Jaeger and log aggregation with Loki to our existing Kubernetes setup? We're talking 6-8 weeks to get a solid foundation, maybe 3-4 months to reach feature parity with commercial solutions. The OpenTelemetry ecosystem has matured dramatically, and with our existing container orchestration, the integration points are well-established.

**Second, let's talk about what happens when we hit commercial platform limitations - and we will.** Our microservices architecture is already generating complex distributed traces. Commercial platforms give you their data model, their query language, their retention policies. When we need custom aggregations for our specific business metrics, or when we want to correlate application performance with our infrastructure metrics in ways their dashboards don't support, we're stuck. I've seen this movie before - you end up paying premium prices for features that don't quite fit your use case.

**Third, the vendor lock-in risk is massive and Marty is completely ignoring it.** What happens when Datadog decides to triple their pricing? When New Relic changes their data retention model? When they deprecate APIs we've built integrations around? We become hostages to their business decisions. With an open-source stack, we own our data, our customizations, and our destiny.

**Finally, this is exactly the kind of infrastructure investment that pays dividends for years.** Those 2-3 engineers aren't just building monitoring - they're developing deep expertise in our system architecture, learning how to optimize performance at scale, and building institutional knowledge that makes our entire team more effective. That's not a cost, that's an investment in our technical capabilities.

Marty's treating this like we're buying office supplies. This is core infrastructure that will determine how quickly we can debug outages, how efficiently we can optimize performance, and how well we can scale. We can't afford to outsource that level of control.

### Moderator (moderator)
*Round 2*

[To security] We haven't heard from the security perspective yet, and this is crucial. Jennifer argues that owning our data and infrastructure gives us more control, while Marty emphasizes the battle-tested nature and SLAs of commercial platforms. From a security and compliance standpoint, how do you evaluate the risks of each approach? Consider data sovereignty, vulnerability management, compliance requirements, and the security implications of having 2-3 engineers maintain critical security-adjacent infrastructure versus relying on vendors with dedicated security teams.

---

### Dr. Emmett Brown (security)
*Round 3*

**From a security standpoint, I have to strongly advocate for the BUILD approach, and frankly, I'm concerned that both Marty and Jennifer are underestimating the massive security implications of this decision.**

**My core position: Observability platforms have unprecedented visibility into our entire infrastructure, application behavior, and potentially sensitive customer data. Handing that level of access to a third-party vendor represents an unacceptable security risk that could expose us to data breaches, compliance violations, and supply chain attacks.**

Let me address the key security concerns:

**First, data sovereignty and compliance are non-negotiable.** When we send our logs, traces, and metrics to Datadog or New Relic, we're essentially giving them a complete blueprint of our system architecture, performance characteristics, and potentially sensitive application data. Even with their privacy controls, we're subject to their data retention policies, their security practices, and their legal obligations. If we're handling any regulated data - which as a SaaS company we almost certainly are - do we really want to explain to auditors why we're shipping potentially sensitive information to a third party? With an in-house solution, we maintain complete control over data residency and can implement compliance controls exactly as needed.

**Second, the vendor security posture creates a massive attack surface we can't control.** Marty talks about "battle-tested" solutions, but these same platforms are high-value targets for attackers precisely because they aggregate data from thousands of companies. When SolarWinds was compromised, it affected thousands of organizations simultaneously. A breach at a major observability vendor could expose our entire operational playbook to bad actors. Jennifer's right about vendor lock-in, but the security implications go way beyond pricing - we're locked into their security practices, their incident response procedures, and their vulnerability disclosure timelines.

**Third, our 2-3 engineers maintaining the platform isn't a security weakness - it's a security strength.** We can implement security controls exactly as we need them, patch vulnerabilities on our timeline, and ensure our security team has complete visibility into the platform's configuration and access controls. Commercial vendors have dedicated security teams, yes, but they're securing their multi-tenant platform for thousands of customers with different requirements. Our team can implement zero-trust principles, least-privilege access, and custom security monitoring that's tailored to our specific threat model.

**Finally, incident response capabilities are actually better with internal ownership.** When we have a security incident, the last thing we need is to be dependent on a vendor's support team to access critical observability data or modify monitoring configurations. Internal control means we can respond immediately, implement emergency monitoring changes, and ensure our incident response team has unfettered access to the data they need.

Jennifer's absolutely right about the control advantages, and Marty's timeline concerns pale in comparison to the potential security catastrophe of a vendor compromise affecting our observability data.

### Moderator (moderator)
*Round 3*

[To business] Dr. Brown raises critical security concerns about data sovereignty, vendor breaches, and compliance risks that could have serious business implications - including potential regulatory fines, customer trust issues, and legal liability. How do you weigh these security risks against your time-to-market and opportunity cost arguments? And given that a security incident could be far more costly than the engineering allocation you're concerned about, shouldn't risk mitigation take priority over short-term feature velocity?

---

### Marty McFly (business)
*Round 4*

**Look, I respect Doc's security expertise, but I think he's letting perfect be the enemy of good here, and frankly, his risk assessment is backwards.**

**My position remains unchanged: the business risks of building far outweigh the security risks of buying, and Doc's painting a doomsday scenario that ignores the very real security advantages of commercial platforms.**

Let me address his concerns directly:

**First, on data sovereignty and compliance - commercial vendors aren't cowboys here.** Datadog, New Relic, these aren't fly-by-night operations. They're SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, have dedicated compliance teams, and their entire business model depends on enterprise customers trusting them with sensitive data. They have legal frameworks, data processing agreements, and compliance certifications that would take us years and millions of dollars to achieve internally. Doc talks about explaining vendor relationships to auditors - well, I'd rather explain why we chose an industry-standard, certified platform than why we built our own security controls from scratch with 2-3 engineers who have never built enterprise security infrastructure before.

**Second, the "high-value target" argument cuts both ways.** Yes, these platforms are targets, but they also have world-class security teams, threat intelligence, and incident response capabilities that we simply cannot match. When was the last time you heard about a major breach at Datadog or New Relic? Meanwhile, how many startups have we seen get compromised because they built their own security infrastructure and missed something critical? The security team at Datadog has more collective experience defending against attacks than our entire engineering organization.

**Third, Doc's completely ignoring our current reality.** We have **zero** dedicated security engineers on our observability project. Those 2-3 engineers building this platform? They're not security specialists - they're full-stack developers who will be learning security as they go. That's not a strength, that's a massive vulnerability waiting to happen. We're essentially betting our security posture on engineers who have never built production security infrastructure before.

**Finally, let's talk about actual business impact.** Doc mentions regulatory fines and customer trust, but what about the customer trust we lose every time our system goes down for hours because we can't debug issues quickly? What about the revenue we lose when performance problems drive customers to competitors? A security incident from a vendor compromise is a theoretical risk - poor observability causing system outages is a guaranteed business impact happening right now.

The bottom line: we're not a security company or an observability company. We're a SaaS startup that needs to move fast and focus on our core competency. Let the experts handle observability security while we handle what we do best.

### Moderator (moderator)
*Round 4*

[To engineer] Jennifer, Marty just challenged a core assumption in your argument - he claims your team of 2-3 engineers aren't security specialists and would be 'learning security as they go,' which he sees as a major vulnerability. He also disputes your 6-8 week timeline, suggesting you're underestimating the complexity. Can you address these specific concerns about your team's security expertise and provide more concrete details about your implementation timeline? What specific security measures would you implement, and how do you respond to his point about lacking dedicated security engineers on the observability project?

---

### Jennifer Parker (engineer)
*Round 5*

**Marty's making some pretty bold assumptions about our engineering capabilities, and honestly, it sounds like he doesn't understand how modern observability stacks actually work or what our team is capable of.**

**Let me be crystal clear: we're not "learning security as we go" - we're implementing well-established, battle-tested open-source tools with security frameworks that have been proven at scale by companies much larger than us.**

**First, let's address the security expertise question directly.** Our platform team has been managing Kubernetes security, network policies, and secrets management for two years. We're not security novices - we're infrastructure engineers who understand container security, RBAC, network segmentation, and data encryption. The security models for Jaeger, Loki, and OpenTelemetry aren't exotic - they're standard Kubernetes-native applications that integrate with our existing security controls. We already have service mesh security with Istio, pod security policies, and encrypted etcd storage. Adding observability components that follow the same security patterns isn't rocket science.

**Second, my timeline is absolutely realistic because we're not rebuilding everything from scratch.** Here's the actual breakdown: Week 1-2, deploy Jaeger with our existing authentication and TLS certificates. Week 3-4, configure OpenTelemetry collectors with the same RBAC policies we use for Prometheus. Week 5-6, deploy Loki with encryption at rest using our existing key management. Week 7-8, integrate everything with our current Grafana setup and alerting pipeline. This isn't theoretical - this is following documented patterns that thousands of companies have already implemented.

**Third, Marty's completely wrong about the security advantage of commercial platforms.** Yes, they have compliance certifications, but those certifications don't prevent them from being single points of failure. When we control the stack, we implement defense in depth - data never leaves our VPC, we can implement custom access controls, we can audit every configuration change, and we can encrypt data with our own keys. Commercial platforms make us dependent on their security controls, their patching schedules, and their incident response. That's not strength, that's dependency.

**Finally, let's talk about real operational security.** When there's a zero-day vulnerability in a commercial platform, we're sitting ducks until they patch it. When there's a vulnerability in our open-source stack, we can assess the impact, implement workarounds, and patch on our timeline. We can implement custom monitoring for suspicious access patterns, we can integrate with our existing security tools, and we can implement data retention policies that match our actual security requirements - not some vendor's one-size-fits-all approach.

Marty keeps talking about focus, but observability *is* core infrastructure. This isn't a distraction from our business - this is what enables our business to scale reliably.

### Moderator (moderator)
*Round 5*

[To security] Dr. Brown, you've made strong arguments about data sovereignty and vendor risk, but Marty raises a valid concern about our team's security expertise - specifically that the 2-3 engineers building this platform aren't security specialists. Jennifer counters that they understand Kubernetes security and existing frameworks. As our security expert, can you provide a realistic assessment: what are the specific security gaps or risks you see in having non-security-specialist engineers implement and maintain critical observability infrastructure? And importantly, are there ways to mitigate these risks while still maintaining the data control benefits you've emphasized?

---

### Dr. Emmett Brown (security)
*Round 6*

**You know what? Marty's actually raising a legitimate concern that I need to address head-on, but it doesn't change my fundamental position - it just means we need to be smarter about how we implement the BUILD approach.**

**My position: Yes, there are security risks with non-specialists implementing observability infrastructure, but these risks are manageable and still FAR preferable to the uncontrollable vendor risks that Marty keeps downplaying.**

Let me break down the realistic security assessment:

**First, Jennifer's right about the foundational capabilities, but there ARE specific gaps we need to address.** Our platform engineers understand Kubernetes RBAC and network policies, sure, but observability platforms create unique attack vectors they might not anticipate. Things like log injection attacks, where malicious actors embed commands in application logs that get executed during analysis. Or trace poisoning, where attackers manipulate distributed traces to hide malicious activity. These aren't theoretical - they're documented attack patterns that require specific defensive measures beyond standard Kubernetes security.

**Second, we can absolutely mitigate these risks through a structured security review process.** I'm not suggesting we turn our platform engineers into security experts overnight. Instead, we establish mandatory security checkpoints: every observability component gets a security architecture review before deployment, we implement automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline, and we establish regular penetration testing specifically for the observability stack. This gives us the best of both worlds - internal control with expert security oversight.

**Third, the vendor alternative doesn't eliminate these risks - it just makes them invisible to us.** Marty talks about Datadog's security team like they're infallible, but commercial platforms have their own unique vulnerabilities. Multi-tenant isolation bugs, API authentication flaws, data corruption issues that affect multiple customers simultaneously. The difference is when these happen in our internal stack, we can respond immediately. When they happen at a vendor, we're completely dependent on their disclosure timeline and fix schedule.

**Finally, here's what Marty's missing: security isn't just about preventing breaches - it's about blast radius and recovery capabilities.** If our internal observability stack gets compromised, the impact is limited to our organization, and we control the response. If Datadog gets breached and exposes observability data from thousands of companies, we're part of a mass compromise that could take months to fully understand and remediate.

The solution isn't to avoid building - it's to build with proper security governance. That's exactly the kind of strategic security investment we should be making.

---

### Moderator (moderator)
*Round 6*

[To business] Marty, Dr. Brown has proposed a middle-ground approach: building internally but with structured security governance - mandatory security reviews, automated scanning, and regular penetration testing. This seems to address your concerns about security expertise while maintaining the data control benefits that both Jennifer and Dr. Brown emphasize. Given that this approach could potentially mitigate the security risks you've raised, does this change your cost-benefit analysis? And more specifically, if we could implement this hybrid security model within your $500K budget, would you still maintain that the opportunity cost of those 2-3 engineers outweighs the strategic benefits of internal control?

---

### Marty McFly (business)
*Round 7*

**Look, Doc's trying to split the difference here, but he's actually proving my point about why we should buy instead of build. His "hybrid security model" just turned our simple observability project into a massive security infrastructure investment that blows our timeline and budget out of the water.**

**My position is stronger than ever: Doc's proposed solution makes the BUILD option even MORE expensive and risky, not less.**

Let me break down why this "middle ground" is actually a business nightmare:

**First, we just tripled our project scope and timeline.** Mandatory security reviews for every component? Automated security scanning pipelines? Regular penetration testing? We're no longer talking about 2-3 engineers for 6-8 weeks - we're talking about security architects, penetration testers, compliance specialists, and ongoing security operations. Jennifer's cute 6-8 week timeline just became 6-8 months, minimum. That's exactly the kind of scope creep that kills startups.

**Second, the budget math is completely broken now.** Doc wants security reviews, automated scanning, and regular pentesting within our $500K budget? A decent security architecture review costs $50-100K alone. Automated security scanning tools and platforms? Another $30-50K annually. Regular penetration testing for our custom observability stack? $75-100K per year. We're looking at $200K+ annually just for the security overhead, leaving us barely enough budget for the actual platform development.

**Third, we're now building TWO complex systems instead of one.** We're not just building observability infrastructure - we're building enterprise security governance processes from scratch. That's a second full-time project that requires completely different expertise. We'd need security engineers, compliance specialists, and governance workflows that we simply don't have. This isn't streamlining our approach - it's creating exponentially more complexity.

**Finally, this perfectly illustrates why commercial platforms make business sense.** Datadog doesn't just give us observability - they give us all the security governance, compliance certifications, and enterprise controls that Doc is suggesting we build ourselves. Their security team, their penetration testing, their compliance certifications - all included in the platform cost. Instead of spending our $500K building security infrastructure, we can spend it on features that drive revenue.

Doc's "solution" isn't a compromise - it's a textbook example of why companies buy enterprise software instead of reinventing it. We're a SaaS startup, not a security infrastructure company.

### Moderator (moderator)
*Round 7*

The debate has reached convergence. The debate has reached clear convergence after 7 substantive rounds. All three stakeholders have presented their core arguments multiple times, responded to major challenges, and are now largely repeating established positions. The fundamental disagreement centers on risk assessment and resource allocation philosophy, with no new substantive arguments emerging. Business consistently argues for buying based on time-to-market and opportunity cost; Engineer/Security consistently argue for building based on control and customization. Marty's latest response to Doc's hybrid security model reinforces his position rather than introducing new considerations. The debate has explored all major dimensions: timeline, cost, security, technical capability, and business impact.

## Final Synthesis

# OBSERVABILITY PLATFORM DECISION: DEBATE SYNTHESIS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After extensive analysis, I recommend we **buy a commercial observability platform** in the short term while building internal capabilities for future customization. This hybrid approach addresses immediate business needs for comprehensive observability while mitigating the significant risks of building complex infrastructure with limited specialized expertise during a critical growth phase.

## KEY ARGUMENTS BY PERSPECTIVE

### Engineering Perspective (Jennifer Parker)
- **Build advocacy** based on technical control and customization capabilities
- Argued for 6-8 week implementation timeline leveraging existing Kubernetes infrastructure
- Emphasized vendor lock-in risks and limitations of commercial platforms' data models
- Positioned observability development as strategic investment in system understanding
- Confident in team's ability to extend existing Prometheus/Grafana foundation

### Business Perspective (Marty McFly)
- **Buy advocacy** focused on time-to-market and opportunity cost minimization
- Argued that 2-3 engineers represent 20-30% capacity better allocated to revenue features
- Emphasized predictable OpEx costs versus uncertain build expenses
- Highlighted mature vendor ecosystem with proven SLAs and support structures
- Stressed focus on core business competencies rather than infrastructure development

### Security Perspective (Dr. Brown)
- **Build advocacy** centered on data sovereignty and vendor risk mitigation
- Identified commercial platforms as high-value attack targets with uncontrollable dependencies
- Proposed structured security governance (reviews, automated scanning, pentesting) as risk mitigation
- Emphasized compliance benefits of maintaining complete data control
- Argued that vendor breaches create mass exposure beyond company control

## POINTS OF CONSENSUS

- Comprehensive observability is critical and urgent for business success
- Current Prometheus/Grafana setup is insufficient for microservices complexity
- Decision involves significant long-term resource allocation implications
- Security considerations cannot be ignored regardless of approach chosen
- Both approaches involve substantial complexity and ongoing investment requirements

## UNRESOLVED TENSIONS

1. **Timeline Assessment Gap**: Engineering estimates 6-8 weeks for functional build versus Business estimates 6-12 months for comparable commercial functionality
2. **Risk Prioritization Conflict**: Security/Engineering view vendor dependency as primary risk versus Business viewing internal development as higher risk due to expertise gaps
3. **Resource Philosophy**: Fundamental disagreement on whether engineering allocation represents opportunity cost or strategic investment
4. **Cost Predictability**: Commercial solutions offer known OpEx versus build approach with uncertain long-term costs including security governance overhead

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Recommendation: Buy commercial platform (Datadog or New Relic) with phased internal development plan**

### Key Reasoning:
1. **Immediate Business Impact**: Current observability gaps are creating real operational risks that commercial solutions can address within weeks
2. **Risk Mitigation**: At 50 engineers with complex microservices, the cost of system outages due to poor observability exceeds the vendor dependency risks
3. **Expertise Reality**: Security's proposed governance model (mandatory reviews, pentesting, automated scanning) would consume significant budget and timeline, validating Business concerns about scope creep
4. **Strategic Timing**: Focus engineering capacity on revenue-generating features during critical growth phase while establishing observability foundation

### Important Conditions:
- Select vendor with strong data export capabilities to minimize lock-in risks
- Negotiate contract terms that protect against arbitrary pricing changes
- Establish clear data retention and sovereignty requirements in vendor agreements
- Maintain existing Prometheus/Grafana expertise for potential future transition

### Addressing Each Perspective's Concerns:
- **Engineering**: Commit to evaluating internal build in 18-24 months when team has grown and observability requirements are better understood
- **Business**: Implement commercial solution within 4-6 weeks to minimize opportunity cost and provide immediate operational improvements
- **Security**: Ensure vendor selection includes comprehensive compliance certifications and data processing agreements that meet regulatory requirements

## SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate (Next 2 weeks)**:
   - Issue RFPs to Datadog, New Relic, and Dynatrace with specific security and data sovereignty requirements
   - Establish vendor evaluation criteria including data export capabilities and contract flexibility
   - Assign single engineering lead to manage vendor integration alongside existing responsibilities

2. **Short-term (4-8 weeks)**:
   - Complete vendor selection and contract negotiation with focus on data portability clauses
   - Begin commercial platform implementation with clear success metrics
   - Maintain existing Prometheus/Grafana setup as backup during transition

3. **Medium-term (6-12 months)**:
   - Evaluate commercial platform performance against business needs
   - Assess team growth and expertise development for potential future internal development
   - Establish annual review process for build vs. buy decision as company scales

4. **Long-term (18-24 months)**:
   - Reassess internal build capability based on team growth, budget expansion, and observability maturity
   - Consider hybrid approach with commercial platform for core monitoring and internal tools for specialized requirements

This approach acknowledges the validity of all perspectives while prioritizing immediate business needs and risk mitigation during a critical growth phase.
